    "Most of what we've done so far this semester involves having **labeled** data. For these data, we have a set of records where we know the value of the target variable. This allows us to learn some relationship between our feature set and the target variable. We've covered five machine learning algorithms that can do this. Here is a brief, and in no way comprehensive, overview.\n",
