There are 4 comma separated columns in this order: `userid`, `timestamp`, `domain`, and `action`. These fields are of type `int`, `int`, `string`, and `int` respectively. Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions but you only need to give one. **Don't forget that in IPython notebooks you must prefix all bash commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `\"!command arguments\"`.**\n",
