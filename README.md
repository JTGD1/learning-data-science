Learning Data Science
=====================

# Introduction
Some material (mainly IPython notebooks) that can be used to understand data science concepts through illustrated examples using both real world and simulated data.

# Contents
The material in this repository was and is currently being developed for the use in two courses at NYU:
- *Introduction to Data Science* taught by [Foster Provost](http://people.stern.nyu.edu/fprovost/) in Fall 2015. This class was a mix of MBA and Master of Data Science students.
- *Data Mining for Business Analytics* taught by [Robert Moakler](http://moakler.org) in Spring 2016. This class consists of mainly undergraduate students from the Stern School of Business.
